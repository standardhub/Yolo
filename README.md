## What is YOLO Achievement?
The YOLO achievement is awarded for merging a pull request without a code review (i.e., merging a PR directly).

## 🛠 How to do it in practice

#### Here are steps that many users say worked:

#### 1. Create a public repository (you own it). 

#### 2. Make a change on a branch (e.g., edit README.md). 

#### 3. Push that branch to GitHub, open a Pull Request against main/master. 

#### 4. Merge the PR without someone clicking “Approve” (no formal review). E.g., you merge it yourself or merge it before a reviewer formally approves. 

#### 5. After merging, check your profile — the badge should appear (though some report a delay).
